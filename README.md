# FitNUS


FitNUS is an application that integrates a variety of workout plans with locations around NUS. With live data from workout hotspots within NUS, users can select locations based on availability, the weather and their personal goals. 
Based on the location selected, users are then recommended a set of workout plans. If none of the suggestions are appealing, there’s always the option to create a custom workout. 
In addition, there is a community element to the fitNUS application, with the ‘Exercise jio’ option. Here, we hope to engage the NUS community to workout in groups (of course, following COVID-19 regulations), by having exercise or even recreational sports jios at the respective venues.
