# FitNUS


FitNUS is an application that integrates a variety of workout plans with locations around NUS. 

Based on the location selected, users are then recommended a set of workout plans. If none of the suggestions are appealing, there’s always the option to create a custom workout. Users can also begin runs.

In addition, there is a community element to the fitNUS application, with the ‘Exercise jio’ option. Here, we hope to engage the NUS community to workout in groups (of course, following COVID-19 regulations), by having exercise or even recreational sports jios at the respective venues.
